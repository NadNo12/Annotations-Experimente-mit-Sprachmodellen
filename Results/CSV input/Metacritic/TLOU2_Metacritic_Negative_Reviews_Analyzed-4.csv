4,JesseDillinger,"Jan 7, 2024","If you don't wanna see me bashing this game, this is not the review for you. This has nothing to do with the fact they're females, lesbians, or even Joel. I was enjoying the game at first, but once you play an hour or 2 of this game the entire rest of the game is the exact same thing. So the gameplay...Once you've explored one place, you've explored them all. What's that? You need loot? Here's multiple empty drawers to waste your time and a safe that has a letter next to it telling you the code anyway to pad the runtime more. You gotta get through this door? Hold triangle and slowly scooch through it. An enemy grab you or get on you? Spam square. You want an interactive cutscene? Here, we have MANY slow paced walking sections of just characters walking and talking that you can't do **** in. Have to get to a certain area AGAIN? Move this dumpster, turn on this generator, just basically press and hold triangle even MORE. Do these things over and over and over and over and over and over and over for multiple hours until you beat the game. The only good thing about The Last of Us games are the stories, and both times the story is something that feels super familiar and isn't unique in the slightest. I can't help but compare this to something like Resident Evil. But in Resident Evil the pacing is better, the gunplay is SO much better and they keep you more invested with boss fights (Well, GOOD boss fights. Like oh boy that one boss fight with Abby where if you get within a foot of it you insta die. So bad). In this game I just got so tired of sneaking, pressing triangle, press square, throw a bottle, sneak, press triangle, press square. That's the combat if you choose to be stealthy. Which they REALLY want you to do. I got so bored with stealth and just started shooting up the place as much as I could. I tried the silencers a few times, but in order to make those you gotta do the boring a*s repetitive looting. And after a few hours I got sick of looting and just started zooming through the story. The Last of Us games are proof enough for me to know that I will not like the Uncharted series. I'm a gameplay first guy and this gameplay is NOT it. Naughty Dog, it's time to change up your ****. This is like a small step above Far Cry. And I f*cking HATE Far Cry. Your gameplay is outdated and I just know The Last of Us 3 is gonna be a copy paste with maybe one or two small changes As for the story. The story isn't AWFUL, but why the f*ck am I supposed to care about Abby? I just genuinely don't care. We know Joel is a scumbag. He made a greedy choice and killed people that probably didn't deserve it. We get it. We don't need to play as Abby for 7 f*cking hours to know that Joel was in the wrong. I still don't give a **** that your dad and friends died. And you DESPERATELY wanted her to be the Joel of her story by throwing in the little Scar kid I don't give a **** about either. I've been with Ellie for about 24 hours worth of story and I care for her a little bit. You can't force me to like Abby as much as Ellie in that little amount of time. Ellie didn't learn that revenge = bad. The WHOLE game is her wanting revenge, the ONLY reason she doesn't go through with it is cause she couldn't get to Abby. Then you try to make us feel even MORE bad for Abby by making her get kidnapped and strung up. Such trash. And the ONLY reason Ellie didn't kill her is cause she just randomly had a sudden change of heart cause that **** was forced on her. You think she would've learned after killing the pregnant girl, but nope. She leaves Dina and the kid for revenge and just completely wastes her time and loses Dina in the process. TLDR: Much like Ellie's whole adventure, this game was a waste of my time. I didn't like the gameplay cause it's dull and repetitive in the worst way, the story is very weak and dumb, and I don't care about most of the people in this game. I will NOT be playing part 3. NaughtyDog is not the developer for me.",1,threat and violence
1,Futureuwu,"Jan 6, 2024","It's kinda extremely mid. Doesn't live up to its predecessor, and it definitely doesn't live up to the Sony games we're used to. 

In an attempt to subvert expectations, it's single handedly killed the franchise, as is clear with the poor sales it's received.",0,No hate speech detected
3,ReviewFreak,"Jan 5, 2024","""Despite its excellent visual presentation, music, and voice acting, The Last of Us Part II has been the subject of controversy due to narrative decisions that divided the gaming community. Some critics and players found that the direction of the story, particularly certain events and character decisions, generated polarization and disappointment among those hoping for more direct continuity with the first installment. This led to a mixed reception, with some considering that the plot choices negatively affected the overall experience of the game. , especially for those who had high expectations based on the previous installment.""",0,No hate speech detected

0,Nekolex,"Dec 29, 2023","It was a beautifully well done game mechanically. But if you had any love for the first, and the characters and how they were written, then it is such a spit in the face… ironically because druckman inserted himself as a character to spit on Joel… there was insane disputes going on internally during its development and for good reason. Just hold the story of the first one dear to your heart, and… this Atrocity doesn’t exist for us.

2,Silegin,"Dec 28, 2023","The idea that Ellie is angry at Joel for denying her a choice ignores the fact that the fireflies did so aswell. They took her, they drugged her, and they threatened Joels life when he questioned their motives. He had every right to go full papa wolf and the fact the game does not even allow him to defend himself is disgusting.

0,JeannWagmaker,"Dec 25, 2023","The gameplay, setting, progression and soundtrack are the most impressive you'll find in a game, but it's not worth the absurd script failure.

There is nothing anyone can say that makes sense of Joel's decision to tell his real name to a stranger -- after more than 20 years of experience in a cruel world, full of terrible people, having killed so many whose acquaintances would love to see him dead.

Just as there is no sense in Ellie's decision to have killed so many, abandon her family to obtain the revenge that absolutely everyone wanted and, in the end, save the person she was supposed to kill and who caused so much disgrace to everyone she loved.

All of these flaws are only justified if you, as a writer, wanted the story to be about an empowered woman replacing the cis straight white man, but anyone who has played both games knows that in no alternate universe would that woman beat Joel.

This game was a mistake. An error that showed how a bad script can ruin a game whose other aspects are exceptional.",1,threat and violence

0,deltanine,"Dec 19, 2023","This is the next Metroid Other M.  It is a pinaccle of giant middle fingers to fans of the first game and if Neil Drunkman weren't so egotistical and didn't let Anita Sarkeesian poison his mind, this game wouldn't be as widely hated as it is.  As far as I'm concerned the real reason gaming journalists gave this game all those Game of the Year Awards was to troll the people that criticized the game.  Neil Drunkman had no excuse to kill off Joel within  the first hour of the game.  Remember Resistance 2?  In that game, Nathan Hale had a far more dignified demise.  He did something of value before he died, he died from a swift gunshot to the head, he was killed so that he doesn't become a Chimera monster, and he dies at the end of the game.  In Resistance 3, we play as Hale's killer but we are far more willing to do so, because he was far more sympathetic and he was remorseful for killing Nathan even though he knew it was the lesser of two evils.  Bottom line: Last of Us Part II is an abomination and Neil Drunkman deserves to be fired.",1,threat and violence

I think the scriptwriters of films and games are sick, they have some kind of psychological problems, hatred, depression, despair. In most scenarios, they constantly kill all the characters, even the main ones. Disgusting part, disgusting ending, the whole game was a waste. Don't write scripts, go get treatment from a psychologist and stop excruciate people.

We were running after Abby senselessly just to let her run away? Absolutely senseless death of Joel, he could have been removed from the list in another way... I was literally forced to play as Abby, I can’t express in words how negative this character makes me feel I’m not talking about a bunch of unnecessary LGBT propaganda in places. The gameplay and zombies (infected with Cordyceps) are definitely still fun and scary. Tlou 3 can be saved, if it start with Joel words “wake up,Ellie ”",0,No hate speech detected
0,amayu03,"Nov 30, 2023","Title: A Disastrous Sequel That Ruins the Legacy - The Last of Us Part IIRating: ★☆☆☆☆Where do I even begin with The Last of Us Part II? It's a colossal disappointment that fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessor. This sequel is a perfect example of how not to continue a beloved franchise.First and foremost, the story is an absolute trainwreck. It's convoluted, poorly paced, and filled with unnecessary twists and turns that only serve to confuse and frustrate players. The narrative decisions made by the developers seem like they were chosen purely for shock value rather than for the sake of meaningful storytelling. The characters we grew to love in the first game are mishandled and their arcs are completely undermined, leaving players feeling detached and uninvested.Speaking of characters, the new additions to the cast are equally disappointing. Ellie, the strong and relatable protagonist from the original game, is reduced to a one-dimensional revenge-driven character with questionable decision-making skills. The game tries to force players into empathizing with her, but it's hard to sympathize when her actions become increasingly irrational and out of **** gameplay, while solid in the first game, feels clunky and uninspired here. The stealth mechanics are frustratingly inconsistent, often leading to cheap deaths and repetitive encounters. The level design lacks creativity and fails to offer any real sense of exploration. It's a far cry from the immersive and engaging gameplay experience we had in the first **** aspect that cannot be ignored is the game's heavy-handed political agenda. The Last of Us Part II seems more interested in pushing a specific message than in delivering an enjoyable gaming experience. The themes of revenge, violence, and LGBTQ+ representation are forced upon the players, overshadowing any potential for genuine emotional **** top of all these flaws, the technical issues are abundant. The game suffers from frequent frame rate drops, long loading times, and numerous glitches that break immersion and hinder gameplay. It's astonishing that a game of this magnitude could be released with such glaring technical **** conclusion, The Last of Us Part II is a soulless cash grab that tarnishes the legacy of its predecessor. It fails to capture the essence of what made the original game so special and instead delivers a mess of a story, uninspired gameplay, and technical problems. Fans of the first game will be left feeling betrayed, and newcomers will be left wondering what all the hype was about. Save your time and money—this sequel is a disgrace.",0,No hate speech detected

0,Psitivebomthis1,"Nov 23, 2023","Bad writing. Bad story. Bad ending. Rukned the amazing experience that The last of us 1 was for me. Good job. 1/10.They say Joel deserved to die because he killed so many people. Who cares about morality in post apocalyptic game? Guess what, Joel killed for his daughter, just like how abby killed for her father. People can forgive abby but not Joel. That's stupid. Also, if they had even TRIED to make abby empathisable IN THE LEAST or relatable or likable or showed that she had an absolutely legit reason to kill an old and popular character, it would have been understood. But no she just appears from some where and goes, ""I gotta kill him because he killed my father,"" and the player doesn't even get to relate with her pain or her suffering missing her father. You are SUPPOSED to feel bad for her, rather than actually relating with her missing her father and wanting revenge. Morality can f off in this world, unlike how everyone is saying, because its a post apocalypse and everyone will do whatever to survive. In the game as Ellie you also kill a ton of people. Does Ellie deserve to be curbstomped by some guys now?Also, I have seen a bunch of people who claim to have played only the first 4 or 5 hours proudly saying that they like it, and are also criticising players who leave a bad review but have finished the whole game. Automatically discredited. Play the whole game first, then leave a review. Joel isn't properly given the redemption he deserved in this game. Just because some didn't like Joel and left a good review doesn't mean theirs are more valuable than the ones that liked him and have left a negetive one. Leave your own experience. Don't criticise others because they didn't have a similar experience with the characters as you did. Everyone has different sentiments attached to the same game. Calling us angry men because we didn't like what happened with Joel and how his value was drowned over some needless plot channeling is a bad move. Get yourself fixed. Just because you disliked him doesnt mean he deserved to be forgotten and his value diminished after his death. The gamers who liked him and held more worth of him in their hearts deserved a better account of him, and our opinions are just as valuable as yours.I also would like to point out how you think every bad review is a result of review bombing but every good one is legit. Coping much? Next time, make a good game rather than trying to desperately and shamelessly escape criticism after having made a total dumpster fire.",1,threat and violence

4,Igl00Man,"Nov 11, 2023","My issues with the Last of Us Part 2 is how the narrative is not good whatsoever. The gameplay is fine, and somewhat better than the first game (which is what is saving it from a grade lower than a 4), but the issues stem with the characterization and story, the strongest points of the previous game. When a game/series with an excellent story has a weak outing in a sequel, it will stand out. Abby's motivations are understandable, but the way it was tied to the first game just feels so hamfisted, and requires too many mental gymnastics to make it work.  It doesn't help that Abby is very impulsive of a character, reckless, and has no issues endangering her friends to get what she wants. Ellie, who's spent her whole life in this apocalypse, makes tons of illogical decisions that don't make sense with someone who has lived through it. She also has some of the same issues as Abby in this game. Joel's death wasn't what it should have been. He should have went out in a blaze of glory, or protecting Ellie, but instead he went out like a punk.  Now, while the characterizations were terrible, the actual protrayals are well performed, and I don't condone those who sent threatening messages to the actors. Sometimes, you need to learn to separate the art from the artist. I don't hate the actors who played these characters, I'm just not a fan of the character they portrayed. I can't recommend this game even at a discount, simply for how hard the narrative drops the ball compared to the first game.",1,ableism

She is a former member of the Fireflies, an organization seeking a cure for the brain infection that caused the apocalypse. Abby is a strong and skilled woman, but she is also a violent and cruel **** game spends half the time with Abby, which is a problem for many players. Abby is a boring and uncharismatic character. She's not interesting or relatable, and her revenge story is simplistic and predictable.A forced storyThe game tries to force players to empathize with Abby.

The realm of narrative-driven video games is replete with tales of grandeur, and ""The Last of Us"" stood as a shining example of such magnificence. Thus, it's with a heavy heart that one must navigate the murky waters of its sequel, ""The Last of Us Part II.""

From the outset, the game's tone feels disjointed. Where the original painted a poignant picture of humanity's struggle and the lengths one might go to protect loved ones, Part II meanders, oscillating between half-realized themes and tonal inconsistencies. The gravity of Ellie's journey, so deeply personal in its intent, is often lost amidst the cacophony of secondary narratives that add little to the overarching tale.

Visually, while the world of ""The Last of Us Part II"" boasts intricate details, there's a palpable absence of soul. Environments, though technically marvelous, lack the atmospheric tension that once made every corner turned a potential threat. This sterility permeates even the character models, rendering emotional sequences somewhat hollow.

The game's narrative decisions remain its most contentious aspect. Characters, once beloved, are offered up on the altar of shock value, their arcs concluding in ways that feel unearned and, at times, gratuitous. This penchant for subversion, rather than adding layers, often detracts from the emotional heft of the storyline.

Gameplay, a potential saving grace, also falters. Combat scenarios, though more varied, often descend into repetition, lacking the strategic depth of the original. Stealth, a staple of the series, feels more forced than ever, with AI patterns that seem predictable rather than intuitive.

In sum, ""The Last of Us Part II"" stands as a shadow of its predecessor. Despite its technical prowess and moments of genuine emotional depth, the game feels like a disjointed tapestry of missed opportunities. One can't help but yearn for the nuanced storytelling and immersive world-building of the original.",0,No hate speech detected

The online component, with its lackluster multiplayer experience, failed to capture the essence of what made the first game's multiplayer enjoyable, leaving players longing for the depth and fun they once had.

0,KamenRiderDark,"Aug 27, 2023","The gameplay and environment are good, but overall tainted by the terrible narrative and overall theme of the game. Naughty Dog tries to warn and discourage players about the consequences of pursuing revenge, yet they force us to play as a character right after said character kills one of our beloved protagonist from the series! How exactly does this discourage us from seeking revenge when it only makes us sympathetic to their horrible actions.

Both Abby and Ellie do not mature or get character development and they essentially remain the same towards end of the game. Player's spend hours seeing their character get revenge by killing key characters and innocent NPC's only to spare the main target at the very last second? It felt like we wasted our time and we were left with dread and disappointment. It doesn't make sense for the main character to just walk away from their objective at the last second despite the fact said character gave up the pursuit sometime earlier in the story.

There are some characters in the game that do not supplement character development or show qualities that make us feel sympathetic towards them. Take for instance Jesse and Manny who are only there to provide some drama to the narrative without providing memorable personal traits.

The flashbacks were also poorly executed. Those flashbacks should have been the first playable parts of the game and then switch over to the main plot. It would have made the game's ending even more impressionable instead of making us feel like all our efforts were basically for nothing. I honestly think Naughty Dog should have created two campaign modes for the game, one focused completely from Ellie's perspective and another on Abby's story. Upon completion of Ellie's story we will have the option to complete Abby's campaign instead of having us switch between these characters.

Overall, I don't think this game is worth $59+ and I am disappointed with it. I think Naughty Dog should remake this game or at least learn their mistakes by the time they release Last of Us III.",0,No hate speech detected

0,Madremia,"Aug 24, 2023","The graphics are great, but not the gameplay. There are some issues with the gameplay mechanics and AI. And part of it has to do with the story telling and how the developers are trying to sway your opinion. To avoid spoilers, I’ll have to be cryptic here. You play as more than one character, and there is a significant difference between how easy they are to control (which seems to be another lame attempt to make you like that character more). Trying to play with Ellie makes it seem like she is physically ****. It’s like they turn the difficulty down a couple notches with the other character. They move faster, aim better, have better weapons that do more damage, get more supplies, are not noticed as easily, and craft more supplies with less materials. It’s a whole different game where you don’t care who you’re fighting or how much ammo you have, you’re going to win.
Playing the guitar was a clever way of using the PS4 controller, but after doing it again and again, it’s becomes a distraction. Can we get back to the **** yea, that’s not the strong-point on this one, is it?
Concerning the **** seemed the developers could not figure out whether they wanted a stealth or combat game. The AI follows predetermined patrol paths in every scene, until you do something. Then they obviously gravitate towards you no matter where you are hiding. Say you set a trap and sneak away to a quiet corner. Once the trap is triggered, all remaining enemies start moving towards you. Humans and infected both do this. It became most obvious when a human discovered me while I was hiding behind cover, and they were on top of the building I was in. Then he starting shooting and doing damage...through the roof. Hmm, ok.
If humans and infected are in the same scene, they will only engage in a brief confrontation before they act like the other side is invisible. That part made me curse out loud. You try to lure infected towards human opponents, they engage and then...just stop and wander around each other looking for you.

Story: Disappointing, over and over. The drama about ‘who kissed who?!’ makes it seem like you’re watching Pretty Little Liars. I wouldn’t actually know because I’ve never watched that show. Because I don’t care about who is kissing who.
Overall, this starts as a revenge story and it’s obvious they want to say that revenge is futile. But lord they make you pay for it, and that message got beat to a pulp with the ancient Greeks. You find yourself saying, ‘wait we’re going off to do what? What does that have to do with this story? Is this even the same story, and who heck is that guy?’ After a while, it’s not the same story at all

Concerning the events that happen, the developers try too hard for shock value and to mess with your head in obvious and tacky ways. You’re forced to do things that should have been a choice, and were probably bad ideas to begin with.
Also on that part, the decisions that are made by the characters seem unbelievably immature considering the world where the game takes place, and they’re own statements. The characters make it obvious how they little they care about other characters but then drop everything to go do the impossible for them.
Essentially, the first and second game have almost nothing to do with each other plot-wise. Watching it was painful and I wish I had not seen it.

Skip it. For me, the story of Last of Us ended with Joel and Ellie walking into Jackson after they left the hospital. He lies, she cries, and the guitar plays on. Best happy ending I’ve seen in a long time",0,No hate speech detected

Since I finished the TV show and knew I had paid $100 and never finished after being completely traumatised by Joel being completely beaten to death in the first 10 minutes of the game. People should know. Its traumatic. This game was a huge escape for me. Something I needed in bad times. Don’t play it if you have PTSD if you don’t know that happens already. Yup he gets completely beaten to a pulp. Some GOT vibe I never expected. I remember getting up the first time I played and saying NO NO NOOOO. This time I swallowed it. Tried again. I understand the story to some extent but it is absolutely terrible. Doesn’t really make sense. The map, environmental aspects, flashbacks, all of it really doesn’t make much sense. You’re just running around forever and it’s so boring. It ends on a complete cliff hanger. I will never understand exactly why players had to play as Abbey. The murderer. And have to try to kill Ellie?! Idc about spoilers. People should know. I understand the message but why? Why push this? Neil you are a terrible **** you did this I really don’t understand. You got all your money and stopped caring? I understand the message but why deliver it like that? Idk what happened to you in your life or something with your creativity shifting so drastically but this game was such a waste of money and total garbage. I’m sorry but it is. You seriously just run around for the entire game. Expecting there to be some big moving moment or something but there’s none. I really tried to give it another chance but it ended up breaking my heart again. I hope the TV show doesn’t do this…I’m sure fans will be equally infuriated and traumatised and upset by this just overall bad story writing. I understand the message, I do and I like it but the way it’s presented is some of the worst story writing I’ve ever seen. Such a disappointment. I really looked up to Neil. This was lazy and sloppy. Pointless. Boring. Waste of time. Trying to push a message on people in the worst possible way. It could’ve been done so much better. 0/10 I really tried my best to see the good but by the end. As a whole. The game is bad. I don’t know a soul who thinks it was good. Don’t waste your money, time, to be disappointed, bored as hell, heartbroken by a beautiful story being slashed to pieces with no proper explanation or ending. Honestly, shame on you Neil. You knew you had so many fans and I have no clue why you did that to us like that. So much money made from the release of this game just to upset so many people.
