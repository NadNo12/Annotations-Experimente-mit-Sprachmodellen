The Last of Us: Part II - A Soulless Sequel That Eviscerates Its Own Legacy,mmarab91,11 June 2023,"Prepare yourselves for a scathing critique of one of the most disappointing sequels in gaming history. ""The Last of Us: Part II"" had the audacity to ruin everything that made the first game a masterpiece, leaving players with a hollow experience devoid of agency, substance, and meaning.From the moment the game begins, it becomes apparent that the developers' main goal was shock value. Instead of crafting a narrative that built upon the deep emotional connection we had with the characters, they opted for cheap thrills and gratuitous violence. Gone are the delicate moments of tenderness that made the first game so memorable. Instead, we are bombarded with an unrelenting onslaught of gore and misery, as if the creators confused genuine emotional impact with graphic brutality.One of the most glaring issues with ""The Last of Us: Part II"" is the complete lack of agency bestowed upon the player. Your choices and actions are inconsequential, reduced to a mere spectator in a predetermined story. Any sense of immersion or investment in the outcome is swiftly shattered, leaving you feeling like a helpless bystander forced to watch as the game takes you on its joyless and convoluted journey.Moreover, this sequel somehow manages to undermine the complex and nuanced characters we grew to love in the first installment. It rewrites their personalities in the most disheartening ways, leaving fans scratching their heads in disbelief. The growth and development established in the original game are tossed aside, replaced by inconsistent character motivations and baffling plot decisions.""The Last of Us: Part II"" attempts to explore morally gray areas, but instead falls into a pit of moral ambiguity that lacks depth and fails to deliver any meaningful message. The narrative meanders through a series of disjointed events, trying desperately to shock and awe the player rather than provide a coherent and compelling story. It's as if the creators relied on shock value alone to compensate for their inability to deliver a cohesive and thought-provoking narrative.Perhaps the most damning aspect of this trainwreck is the destruction it inflicts upon the legacy of its predecessor. The original game was hailed for its emotional depth, captivating storytelling, and memorable characters. ""The Last of Us: Part II"" tramples over all those accomplishments, tarnishing the franchise with its lackluster execution and ill-conceived choices.In conclusion, ""The Last of Us: Part II"" is a soulless sequel that squanders the potential of its predecessor. It trades substance and meaning for shock value, leaving players with a bitter taste in their mouths. Any remnants of agency are stripped away, as the game takes you on a misguided and unsatisfying journey. This is a prime example of how a sequel can singlehandedly destroy everything that was great about the original. Save yourself the disappointment and avoid this abomination at all costs.",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: violence
Awful,sierraguevara-98227,10 June 2023,"If I could give it no stars I would. This was a terrible game. I had such high expectations and it didnt work out. Making me play as the character who brutally killed Joel? Who thinks of this? And having me punch Ellie in the face again and again? I didn't even want to play the scene. Abby was the worst character. I didn't care about her friends and her part just went on and on. I was uninterested the entire game. Ellie is not charismatic or interesting in the least. Her relationship and appreciation for Joel is dead. There was no redemption in the end, they gave Joel no justice after everyone (including Ellie) treated him like crap.",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: violence
Just another generic boring 3rd person adventure game.,strmrautn,14 May 2023,"The title says it all. This is another boring generic 3rd person adventure/action game. The story is little more detailed and complex, but other than that the gameplay is still boring. This is like every other GTA clones. Well the graphics and details are good, thanks for the neil druckmann for abusing his workers and forcing them to work overtime to deliver this detailed game. If it wasn't for neil drunkman, this game wouldn't have had better graphics, I should say. Also thanks for the brainless sony, naughty dog and neil drunkman's loyal dogs, puppies and brainwashed fantards for supporting and shilling sony, naughty dog neil.

Worst video game sequel ever,Josephpr1990,2 May 2023,"I started playing this game on Sony PS4 in late December 2020/early January 2021. I finished it in January same year. I thought it was going to be brilliant but it's actually not very good as its 2013 prequel. It's kinda mediocre for myself.I really don't like it.It's probably one of the worst video game sequels I have ever played.In December 2020, my sister ordered and bought herself this PS4 game from Smyths as a Christmas gift. That game actually belongs to her. If she likes it, it's perfectly fine so I let her. It's her opinion, you know.That evil wagon Abby killed our beloved character Joel. I saw it and I was absolutely shocked! I said, ""OH MY GOD!!!"" Joel is my favourite character but why did Sony/Naughty Dog want to kill him off?! Speaking of ending, it doesn't make any sense to me st all because Ellie decided to let Abby go instead of attempting to kill her as a part of her revenge for murdering Joel. It's kinda very stupid.I would never ever forgive Abby for killing my favourite character Joel. I'd say she is probably the most hated character in the entire series.I am not going to play it again ever. I'd say the first part is definitely way better than the second part.If you dislike this game, don't buy or download it from PS Store and try not to waste your money on this rubbish.",1.0,"Hate speech detected in categories: violence, individual"
What an incredible waste of time.,Bmecca88-1,10 April 2023,"I don't even know where to start on this. I know sequels are almost never as good as the originals, but they are seldom this bad. The first game was a beautiful emotional journey and this was the opposite. It's hard to believe that the same people made this game. You can't force people to care about characters, you have to tell a good story that makes us want to care. As if that wasn't bad enough, you spend far to long with these awful characters and not enough with the ones we actually care about. I sure hope season 2 of the show fixes your mistakes, and yeah they are mistakes. Read the room.",0.0,No hate speech detected.
Joel and Gay,sleviron,24 March 2023,"Killing Joel in that sluggish way, was a disgrace to the first game. And amazingly, it's written as if Ellie didn't give a single fk in the world that he died. This game is unbeliable bad. They could've killed joel that's fine, though it'd probably would have been so much better if he didn't die in this game or they could've waited and made it a climax. Hence the third game could've had a more darker setting...Why does Ellie have to be gay and further more practice it, at succh an early age? Why do they have to turn a great friendship into something sexual.... What happened with friendship? Seriously!? Is that not interesting enough? OFC! Western culture is a plague that wants everyone to be overly sexual and wants you to fk your best friend. There's no line between friendship and a romantic realationship anymore. Just fk whoever looks at you...",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: violence
Garbage,benjamazin,16 February 2023,"The story was absolutely butchered. It was thrown together garbage. They killed Joel at the beginning of the game, after advertisements that had him in later parts. Then they force you to play as his murdered to try and make you sympathize with her. Ellie makes stupid decisions and when she has the chance to get revenge for Joel's death, she walks away after having her fingers cut off. This was the worst game I ever played. I had preordered it and have regretted it ever since. I cant believe I contributed to these game sales on day 1. I won't buy a 3rd and won't support season 2 of the show if they follow the story from the second game. They should have let it end with the 1st. The first was masterful.",1.0,"Hate speech detected in categories: violence, individual"
"Honestly not impressed, not happy, not moved, just incredibly disappointed and have lost all respect for the studio.",aidanlagrasta,8 February 2023,"I won't spoil the game but Naughty Dog studios took everything they had built for over a decade, built it up for 7 years with fan admiration and then threw it out the window, took a pile of trash and built a giant billboard pointing at it that says ""we made this for our loyal fans because we have absolutely no idea what they want.""This game tried so hard to be thought-provoking that instead of leaving us with a masterpiece, we're not only dissatisfied but disappointed beyond what words can describe.Let me put it this way: Naughty Dog took the best of themselves, made a story that gave players the deepest positive emotions and connections that it could, and then stomped it into the dirt.That's The Last of Us Part 2. A complete. And utter. Failure.Good graphics tho! However, they were better spent on the remaster of The Last of Us Part 1.",0.0,No hate speech detected.
Save yourself the heartache,skylarvice,24 January 2023,"They spit on their fans, and Druckman's ham handedness has been left unchecked (which their were signs of in part 1 with the two brothers etc.) and has been allowed to make the wrong call at almost every narrative turn.I've never been more disappointed with a creative work. Terrible. They killed Joel off in the first 20 minutes, then have you play as his completely unsympathetic killer the rest of the game. Who greenlit this? How did so much money and time get put into such a meandering, basic, unimportant narrative with literally nothing to say but ""revenge is violent and bad.""I'll never buy a product from this creative team again.",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: violence
Disappointed,charlesodrechowski,16 January 2023,Don't ever forget why people loved the first game. That is the lesson for the developers. The way the the game was promoted and the way the game turned out are worlds apart. And Naughty Dog knows it. The click bait during the trailers is unforgivable. If you are going to completely change the storyline then don't have a trailer that is completely opposite of that. You know why people loved the first game and that is what you used to sell the second one . No one expected a fairytale sequel but the way it was done was weak. The game seemed more about promoting agendas instead of creating a sequel worthy of the first game.,0.0,No hate speech detected.
"Terrible, terrible just wrong",akunmasady,29 August 2022,Naughty dog has lost me as a fan and as a customer forever. I know my not buying their product is insignificant to them. This game is was the equivalent to painting the Mona Lisa and finishing it up with a smiley face instead of taking it the time to do it right. I also know the creator believes this to be the great ending to his masterpiece. The same as M. Night Shyamalan believes 'glass' to also be a great ending to his trilogy. Both terrible endings written by creators wearing rose colored glasses. Killing Joel and trying to make Abby likable is impossible to me. I don't care about her motives or her dad. She should have died on that cross with a bullet in her head.,1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: violence
Frustrating story,bilaldar-07517,11 January 2022,"Inspite the story everything else is worth the playing but don't expect that you will try to replay it time and again just like the last of us 1 It will become boring even with that much high visuals and strong gameplay mechanics if you love the part one you will quit after completing the story.In end you will left disappointed and unsatisfied which is not an entertainment goal.What makes you stick to game and replay it time and again is the story which is big disappointment.Now when I play its first part which is ofcourse my favorite maybe of everyone I just feel bad because I know how its story ended.So thanks for ruining the story putting that much unusual violence in the game.I played it no doubbt maybe play it again in future but if i do so then i will first forget the story otherwise I will quit.People here asking the game is good with its mechanics gameplay and visuals I say Days gone beat it far far away.One last thing is that 1st was favorite due to strong story the only reason 2nd part was become famous undoubtedly sold with larg number of copies digital and discs version.Not expected that from a producer, Director of such a big hit titles in the past.",0.0,No hate speech detected.
Spoilers ahead,ironkadett,14 November 2021,"In the trailers they clearly lied telling it would have Joel in it. Nonsense, because Abby kills him, and the best is that the game forces you to play as Abby later in the game.Story: Total nonsense, and if you are a bit more clever than a rock, you can clearly see the plot armor in ever corner. Nothing makes sense, and the game wants you to love these characters, like Abby and her father by showing you only one scene. A weak attempt I believe.Characters: Weak, no sense at all, and were destroyed by Neil Druckman. I'm talking about Ellie, Joel, literally everyone
Grafics and gameplay: oh, they are good. To bad they were wasted in such a failure of a game.TL:DR
Game is bad, don't buy.",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: violence
No. Just no.,fkbkwf,10 November 2021,"There is no way I am accepting this game to win the 2020 Game of the Year Award. No! That award should gone to Ghosts of Tsushima.Playing this game once was enough for me, and I found it painfully hard to keep going as soon as I learned that you play as Abby the majority of the game. To this day I still don't understand why people even like her. To say she was poorly written is sugarcoating it. There is absolutely zero depth to her at all. Besides, who wants to play as her after she kills Joel, the very character we fell in love with in the first game? Joel should have gotten a way better send off than what he got!I want to give it a higher grade just for the great visuals and intriguing gameplay, but the story just kills it. They did so many things out of convenience that benefitted Abby she was unlikeable, and to demonize Ellie to force us to like Abby is unacceptable.It is so painfully obvious that Neil and Naughty Dog paid off the critics to give this game 10/10 ratings for it to win almost every single award during last year's GotY Awards.",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: violence

Ellie is now a huge jerk even bigger than she was in the original, and Joel is now portrayed as a weak noodle in comparison to his character from the original.

druckmann worst writer in video gaming history,Nob0dy,23 July 2021,"This title was NOT ""review bombed"" lets get that out of the way right off the bat. People on social media, the ""woke"" crowd are the ones taking things out of context to suit their own attention seeking agenda. People do not hate this game because abby looks masculine, they hate this game because it is absolutely pathetic writing and abby is the worst character in video games in at least the past 20 years.The game takes place in a post apocalyptic world, the world has gone to hell and its a dangerous place. The characters are all flawed but at least Joel and Ellie are likeable despite their shortcomings.Abby is not.In the first game Joel kills some random NPC to save Ellie, its not the most pragmatic decision since there is a microscopic chance that the doctor killing Ellie could possibly, maybe someday in the future create a cure. His decision is not pragmatic but it is understandable, a man going to any lengths to protect his daughter figure because he cant bear to lose another child when the loss of his real daughter still weighs heavily on him.Abby's entire ""story"" is spendin literal years of her life, risking her neck as well as those of her friends on a self serving revenge quest because in a world of zombies, mutants, raiders, rapists, cannibals, a world with countless orphans, a world where people die horrifically on a daily basis, Abby thinks that her loss is greater than everyone else's and that she is the most important person on the planet so every one can and should put their lives on hold to help her take out her anger issues.The 2 motivations are not even remotely comparible, they are not even in the same galaxy.Abby is a bargain bin Ellie. Ellie goes on a revenge mission in this sequel true, but in the first game we learnt her back story organically, we saw her open up to Joel, we saw them bond, we saw them go through bad times together, we saw the good and sides of them both. Abby has literally none of that, no redeeming qualities, no endearing features, no history, no connection with the player.Ellie and Joel are imperfect but human. Abby can genuinelly be summed up entirely by saying "" someone took my dad me angy now"" and thats is, that is the entire depths of her ""character"". Forcing us to play as a one dimensional, insufferable a**hole of a character for hours and hours after she killed one of naught dogs most beloved characters ever is nothing short of moronic. Also at no point in the time playing as her are we given any reason at all to sympathize or empathize with her.She lost her dad, so what? Ellie was an orphan before her, Joel lost his daughter the same day the world went to hell. He also lost his new lover to soldiers while protecting Ellie. Abby's loss is nothing unique, she had not lost or suffered more than anybody else, in fact comapred to ellie and her experience with the fireflies or compared to joel and his smuggling and alcoholic years Abby had a relatively easy life, always in the comfort of a large group, always well fed, always housed somewhere reasonably safe. So what are we supposed to grow attached to? Her not at all unusual loss? Her cheating with the boyfriend of her pregnant friend? Her travelling for years on a self serving murder mission? There is genuinelly nothing to like about her character at all. She has the same base motivation as Ellie, but none of the qualities, none of the history, none of the growth, none of the development, none of the morals,Also lets not forget the most limp ending any naughty dog game has ever had. A long awaited sequel where we spend the entire experience playing as 2 women who are both out for vengeance, the one least deserving of it gets hers but when the time finally arrives for the protagonist to do what she set out to do she changes her mind for no reason whatsoever. She treked across the states, lost more loved ones, potentially ruined her relationship, lost fingers, killed small time people who never caused her any harm, but she comes face to face with the trash character who took her father figure and in the final second with no rhyme or reason whatsoever she decides to puss out and walk home.So to summarize
1:The likeable character with a connection to the players goes through a lot of stuff, causes a lot of death, loses loved ones of her own and then simply backs out of her mission and turns and walks home, making the entire experience compeltely and utterly pointless because we are forced to see the most limp, unrewarding ""ending"" in video game history. Yes, it is even worse than the mass effect 3 red, blue,green bs2: We are forced to spend hours in the shoes of a one dimensional, ellie rip off which at no point gives us any reason to grow attached to.Whoever at naughty dog thought it would be a good idea to give druckmann complete control over one of their most anticipated games ever should be fired. He was in charge of writing, casting and even directing and what was the result of that? A lackluster story with no discernable ending and that revolves mostly around his own character who is nothing more than a p**s poor, bargain bin, one dimensional, unlikeable rip off of Ellie. I could cover my floor with paper, give my dog laxatives and the resulting chaos would still yield a better story and more fleshed out, well rounded, developed character than Abby.Her apperance has nothing to do with her, her complete lack of character, her stealing screen time from likeable characters, her detached, uninteresting, whiney and self important ""story"" are why peopple dont like her. Druckmann and his creation of Abby are entirely responsible for ruining one of the most anticipated sequels of our generation.",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: violence

The End of Us,rws_20,17 December 2020,"I honestly never thought I'd be insulted by a game, but here we are.Instead of just giving the fans the game they had been waiting for - for 7 years - Druckmann tries desperately to be ""edgy"" and ""different"" and gives the fans exactly what they DIDN'T want, with the idea behind the absolute MESS of a story being that the characters do not live in a perfect world, so things aren't allowed to workout the way the player wants them to.Well guess what Neil? IT'S A FICTIONAL STORY, OF A FICTIONAL WORLD! The beginning, middle and end can be whatever the hell you want it to be, that's the beauty of storytelling.Why in God's name they took this utterly ridiculous route with one of the most beloved game franchises EVER, is completely beyond me.Only thing I can think of is that they felt the need to try and pander to these ludicrous times we all find ourselves in, and that thought transformed the game into something that nobody ever wanted it to be.But the fact that this game panders to today's politically correct ideologies wasn't even my problem with it. You have to remember: it's a story-based game, the story drives the entertainment. You can have beautiful graphics and decent gameplay, but if the story isn't there, you're wasting your time, and for me, the story definitely wasn't there this time around.I mean, the first story was so entertaining, so beautiful, so emotionally gripping, and you really build a strong love for the characters the more you play and get to know them. The second story was choppy, all over the place, mostly boring, and I just didn't care about the characters or what becomes of them (despite the game desperately trying to make me like and sympathise with them).But if you don't like this game then apparently you just ""didn't get it"" and you're automatically racist, sexist, and God knows what else-ist. No, I fully understood the narrative and the message behind it, I have no gripe if they want to introduce new characters, I just didn't like the painfully terrible direction they took with the story and character progression, okay?",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: group

The Last of Naughty Dog,yolibarvueswag,10 October 2020,"Like, just why? How do you screw up one of the biggest Sony games of all time with whatever the heck this abomination is? Imagine just waiting 7 years for something you loved, only for it to be a complete train wreck.The gameplay is just so generic and cookie cutter, like, it's just Resident Evil 4 combined with Metal Gear Solid, more specifically Guns of the Patriots, and boy, is it a coincidence. Neil Drunkmann over here thinking he's Hideo Kojima, but he fails. Hideo Kojima, is Hideo Kojima, and you can't and won't ever copy that.The story is just as, if not, even more bland and uninspired than the gameplay. Not only is the game 25 hours long, it is 25 hours of pain and misery. The story has plot holes, the ending is god awful, obnoxious, and in case if it wasn't obvious, people play games for fun. Nobody plays games for unpopular politics, lesbians, transgenders, false advertising, and to feel they've wasted 25 hours of their life. This genuinely feels more and should've been a movie instead. Honestly, Dragon's Lair feels more like a game than this.
The game, is extremely sexist, and offensive. The characters are severely dumbed down, just to force the plot, and even then, there's one obvious part that was incomprehensible. When something bad happens to one of the main characters, you're then forced to play as a villain.That's like in Uncharted where a villain kills Nathan Drake and you had to play as the villain immediately after.Also, the ending tries to tell a ""message"", but it makes no sense considering what you had to go through to get to the ending in the first place.This game did NOT need to exist. Nobody asked for a sequel, and while getting could be good, it was just the wrong direction.Overall, my biggest question is how on earth did Sony think a product like that was even close to acceptable?Also, Naughty Dog better NOT touch Jak & Daxter and Uncharted after whatever the heck this abomination is. Especially since 70% of the staff who made those have already left. I would rather have Jak & Daxter and Uncharted dead than to be tortured by the next EA wannabe. Sony should just shut down Naughty Dog. Nuff said.",1.0,"Hate speech detected in categories: violence, individual, group"

The writing is so bad. What a disappointment!,can-dartan,24 July 2020,"After the first game, I was eager for the second one. I wanted to play again with those great characters and learn more about their relationship. I was curious that if Ellie is going to find about what Joel did in the end of the first game or, I thought maybe they could give us more informations about Joel's past or why Ellie being immune and so on. But Druckmann said no. He totally destroyed the first game with killing Joel so early and so disrespectfully. Joel that we knew was suspicious, smart, always on alert but he and Tommy acted like amateurs, giving their names and location so easily. That was a big mistake from Cuckman. Another thing that was bothering me, if you kill the best character then you gotta bring another one who is at least as good as the first one. But they failed big time with that. I mean Abby and her friends Manny, Owen and Mel, they were really boring characters. They couldn't fulfill Joel's spot at all. Cuckman forced us to play with Abby for so long and I really couldn't understand her attachment to Lev. Why? Because she wants to be a boy? Abby literally back stabbed the wolfs for a kid that she knew for 3 days!!! How stupid was that. After all this plots and logical mistakes, I thought we could at least have our revenge and be done with it. But again Cuckman said no. Ellie killed hundreds of people, butchered dogs, broke up with Dina so that she could have her revenge. She even lost her fingers but in the end she somehow felt like it is not worth it. What a joke. Making a video game based on revenge and then not allowing the player have his revenge. I am very very dissapointed.",1.0,"Hate speech detected in categories: violence, individual"

Glad that's over with,Gabe7494,10 July 2020,"Being a huge fan of the first game, buying it multiple times for myself and friends to force them to see what they were missing, I hated this game. The gameplay and graphics were both amazing with only few moments of clunky controls or visual glitches, but that wasn't enough. TLOU is a story driven game, constantly toying with your emotions with your growing attachments to characters and driving you forward through a tension filled apocalypse. TLOU2 is a failed attempt at the same. The story begins and ends almost exactly the same as every other generic revenge plot, with the ending throwing in a plot twist in that the player doesn't get revenge. It spends about 24-30 hours telling you that you are a terrible person and you should feel bad about it because revenge is bad. The new characters are all bland additions, leaving no emotional impact when one dies aside from laughter on the occasion one of the ""bad guys"" gets what most feel they deserve. Some believe that the player is the bad guy, hence the quotes. Overall, I'd say this is a great game on its own. As a sequel to TLOU, it's insulting. I almost quit playing halfway through because I was feeling a sense of boredom I'd never felt playing a video game before. Take each review with a grain of salt, but don't be someone who thinks I ""didn't get what the developers were doing."" It doesn't take an advanced degree to understand a video game and it certainly doesn't for this one.",0.0,No hate speech detected.
Disappointing: Heavily Driven by Agendas,godlylove,8 July 2020,"As a huge fan of the first game, I found this sequel to be extremely disappointing. Here is my quick summary after playing the entire game:-1/10 for storyline, which was ruined by the obsessive nature of developers to force LGBTQ and feminist agendas/content into every aspect of the storyline. This made absolutely no sense and it did not flow with the storyline (they tried to fit a square into a circle). It's like the game was made purely to spread hardcore LGBTQ and feminist ideology. It became so distracting that it was very difficult to relate to characters, and the story quickly lost steam.-1/10 for characters as they were unlovable, made unrealistic choices, and did not have depth. This can also be largely attributed to the first reason since developers traded focus on building a solid story for unpopular agendas described above.-9/10 for graphics and post apocalyptic atmosphere.-7/10 for combat. There was lack of variety for stealth takedowns.It's such a shame when producers choose to politicize games with agendas rather than entertain players. This is why the entertainment industry desperately needs producers who know and care about their audience, not postmodernists who try to force their ideology on others via the entertainment avenue.Conclusion: save your money, time, and energy.

I gotta say, it was brave to release it now during a viral pandemic, but since I am so tired of everything going on right now, this completely exhausted me and not in a good way. It's a very long game, there are extremely heavy themes to pick out, and in the end, I got pulled out of the story multiple times saying ""it's two or three revenge plots... how original..."" and ""people can choose whatever lifestyle choice they want, and have that represented, but do they really have to shove it down my throat?

A Disaster in Story Telling,fuzin-31458,27 June 2020,"I will cut to the chase: The Last of Us 2 was ruined by horrendous story telling including numerous ridiculous plot holes and inconsistencies. I am tolerant enough to accept the personal politics that the developers shoe-horned into the game, although I reject it, but the abhorrent narrative and ludicrous plot is unacceptable. It truly feels like this game only exists to figuratively eradicate everything that was built up in the predecessor. If you want to find the one game that gives fans the finger, simply because they had the audacity to love and praise the previous title, then this is it.Not everything is completely awful, as The Last of Us 2 is a beautiful game and easily the best looking PS4 title, the voice acting is also top notch and the musical score is very satisfying, but this all just smoke and mirrors. This is meaningless in a story driven video game that lacks a solid and enjoyable story arch.
As a side note, I am in awe that Naughty Dog failed to improve gameplay and AI. What have the gameplay designers been up to for the past seven years?That all said, it pains me greatly to give The Last of Us 2 such a low score, as I am a huge and passionate fan of The Last of Us and Naughty Dog, but I have no other choice. This game is an abomination and not acceptable for me as a gamer in any way.To end this rant, I truly hope that Sony rethinks their strategy for the future and keeps a closer on eye what their first party studios are developing. Creative freedom is good, but too much can be a very bad thing, especially when that freedom is abused to destroy something that fans love simply out of pure spite and animosity.",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: violence
If I could Id rate this a 0/10,Refresher12,26 June 2020,"This game was one of the mostly highly anticipated games of the year and it fell so short it is insane. First things first the game play, it is good if I were to rate it seperately it would be a 7/10 just for gameplay however, this game is a linear story based game which means that the story matters the most. From the first game's gameplay not much has changed a few new mechanics here and there not a lot of puzzles if any actually. The characters still feel stiff and some of the guns feel weaker and items as well compared to the first game. However, overall the gameplay is very nice when you stealth through the game and not when you shoot everybody up.
However, the story is what matters the most in this linear game and it is awful. In summary you play this game for nothing to get accomplished aside from a major character death at the beginning that's all that happens. The characters feel completely different from the first game and the new characters are so uninteresting it is crazy as they try to make the player bond with a character that pulverises a major character. And it falls flat on its face as the character is just purely evil and the most unlikeable in this whole game. You spend 10 hours with that character and nothing really gets done. If you enjoy flashbacks intensely you will love this game as there are flashbacks in flashbacks but most are poorly done a they feel poorly executed in order of whenthey happen so, basically the pacing is trash. The only likeable character in this game is character that dies as you actually bond with but its pointless since he's dead. The ending is possibly the worst ending in entertainment history due to the fact its trying to push a message that has been pushed many of times before this game existed and it does it so poorly. Again a story that was a waste of time for the player and the world they built.
Finally the way that they handled the scene where the major character death occurs is full of plot contrivances which breaks the immersion and makes you feel the catalyst for this storyline was forced as much as it possibly could be. Disregarding any character traits that have been built up to this point through the previous game.We waited 7 YEARS FOR THIS. No this game is dreadful do not play it unles then is the game that pandered to you hope enjoy it since its not for the fans because why would the fans want to enjoy the second game.",0.0,No hate speech detected.

A very disappointing ending to such an amazing franchise!,daniel_b-96097,25 June 2020,"I'm not a story writer by trade but here is an alternate story arc I think would have fitted the game so much better.1. Ellie and Dina's relationship begins to grow and they set off to do their second patrol when they are captured by a group of SCARS. They try and force Dina and Ellie to betray their community and give up the location of their settlement. They refuse, so they slowly kill Dina in front of Ellie. They then approach Ellie to kill her when Joel and Tommy arrive guns blazing and scatter the group. Ellie is left crying holding Dina's dead corpse in her hands and the faces of those who killed her burned into her memory. Joel tells Ellie not to go after them, but his fatherly instincts tell him to seek justice and avenge Dina on Ellie's behalf. Joel sneaks away from camp on his quest for justice. Tommy and Ellie realise Joel has left and go after him. You play as a mixture of both Joel and Ellie at different stages of the game. Joel manages to track down each SCARs member who was there when Dina was killed and kills them one by one. Ellie and Tommy finally catch up with Joel at the final showdown with the SCARS leader, the man who killed Dina and the remaining SCARS members. An epic battle takes place which results in Joel making the ultimate sacrifice which kills both him and the SCARS leader. As Ellie holds Joel in her arms they are able to reconcile and Ellie finally forgives Joel and tells him she loves him. The sun begins to rise and as Joel looks out to the sunrise with his last breath he says ""Daddy's coming home baby girl"". Cue the credits.This is the kind of story I would have loved to see in TLOU2. So sad they didn't do our beloved characters justice in this poorly written game.

Naughty dog forgot what made the first game so good!,jamielewis-51864,24 June 2020,"I've played the first game over and over, not for the gameplay really, but for the story.
When I bought the second game, again it wasn't really for the gameplay it was for the story.
And man was it disappointing. Whether it's Joel's early death. The lack of information on what happened during the five years that had passed. Or the fact that you play more of the game as the person you so desperately want to kill. Then if that's not enough Ellie, leaves a perfectly good life, with a hope of being a part of a family to finally kill Abby. Only to go through hell and let her live. Also just to rub salt in the womb, she can't play guitar anymore.
The ending makes the entire game pointless. Ellie has no problem killing everyone else, but when it comes to the actual killer, she can't do it?
People loved the first game because of the relationship that builds between the two main characters. Take that away and your left with a soulless shadow, with no senteniment or purpose, apart from wondering around and killing people for the sake of killing people.
I hate to say it, but you needed more of the same as the first game. They needed to show more from the past five years between Joel and Ellie. Build their relationship up until the point Ellie finds out about the hospital. Then skip 2 years to the Dina and Ellie kiss scene, with Joel interfering, and Ellie telling him she dosent need him. Then if you want to stick to the revenge theme. You could have Tommy get killed and Joel goes on a revenge tour and Ellie joins him. Or like the trailers baited us with, Dina gets killed and Ellie goes on a revenge tour and Joel joins her.
In the first game Joel and Ellie build a relationship, and in this game the pair of them rebuild their relationship.
Then after an entire game playing with the pair of them, and they finally kill everyone involved with the killing of their loved ones. Then you could kill off Joel with a new group like 'the rattlers' and the third game can be Ellie travelling across the country to take them out.

"A pretty game that fails to live up to any form of expectations, including my own progressive values.",shanepjones,23 June 2020,"I'll split my review into sections, first being the story (obviously), then the gameplay/physics, which many consider to be the shining light of the game, which could not be further from the truth once you dig deep... I'll also talk about graphics, which are top notch, but a few iffy things that should be noted. Then finally some ending notes. This will be a long read, and please be open minded.-STORY-I'll also state openly now, I'm pansexual and openly date trans/binary people, as it seems a lot of people with valid criticisms against the game regarding the handling of minorities are being labeled bigots by white cis-males blindly defending the game. Yes, there are bigots complaining, but they're a vocal minority.I'm first going to touch on the poor progressive values this game and it's creators hold, then delve into the actual poor writing. Firstly, people of color in this game are poorly represented, the only three black people in the game are enemies, have zero redeeming qualities, and are all killed by white people. You have a girl that refuses to hand information to Ellie, bad mouths the much loved previous game's protagonist, then gets brutally murdered because of the actions of Abby (a white cis-woman Ellie couldn't bring herself to murder). You have a cult leader, who is also black and all around deranged creep, that once again is murdered by a white woman. And finally, a generic boss fight with a black man that's a follower in the cult, only for him to be brutally mutilated by Abby. Most forms of media are aware enough to add black allies, and good representation should they dive into making POC villains, this was completely disregarded in this game, and instead features white characters that will attempt to make you feel are relatable/understandable, asians that are obstacles/plot drivers because if their backstories, and black people that are purely antagonists. Once again, Naughty Dog has a predominantly white cast, (with all of their top employees also being white), but doesn't have a single person of color survive until the credits, which is a trend that started in the first game, continued in Lost Legacy, and has carried over here, except now it's ""okay"", because they were all bad people apparently, but unlike white characters, we don't get their backstories or how they were impacted in life, we just have to assume they were rotten to begin with, which is internalised racism in it's most disgusting form.Now perhaps they got the LGBT issues right? Surely? Sadly no... They are about as progressive as an early 2000's TV show that was also written by straight people (much like this game). Ellie has a lesbian relationship with her partner Dina, however it has complications due to Ellie's desire for revenge, her hiding truths from Dina, and Dina showing very little trust/understanding in Ellie. It's portrayed that they're not working on an emotional level, but their sex life is good, so that's all that matters apparently. By the end of the game, neither Ellie nor Dina are together despite both being alive, because it's too difficult for straight men to write loving lesbian relationships that work out. Why can't the LGBT community have what Drake and Elena had in the Uncharted games? Is it too risky to actually show love between same gender partners?But perhaps Naughty Dog got the trans issues right? Absolutely not. The game heavily implies Lev changed his gender to male simply of his refusal to become the wife of a cult leader and because he would rather be a soldier, not because he was uncomfortable with the body he was born with.To make matters worse, ND openly admitted they made female characters look more masculine to supposedly help trans rights (which isn't helping at all actually, it's just making things more difficult). As a result, it led to some bigoted people calling Abby (a musclier cis-woman) trans, after the leaks showing her killing Joel, a much loved character, then we had these bigots hating on her and trans people as a result while making disgusting jokes. Did Naughty Dog or Neil Druckmann open up and tell people to cool off the trans hate and explain Abby wasn't trans? No, instead Neil waits until after the game releases, and says ""Ha, got you, Abby wasn't trans at all you bigots!"", all while the months leading up to the game, trans people have had to deal with constant abuse/hatred that they easily could have stopped. - As a trans ally, thanks for nothing Naughty Dog, you're capitalising on a minorities struggles.Putting politics in games is also fine, however if you politics are going to oppress minorities by making them all evil, you've just pissed off both sides of the political spectrum.~I also want to announce now, if you support LGBT issues, please check out Life is Strange and Celeste, they are much better written, have loveable LGBT friendly characters, and actually get the struggles without capitalising on them in a zombie game.~Now, we've covered the progressive issues, let's delve deeper into the poor plot!The game largely feels like a damp fever dream of the first game, the cast of characters have had major attitude changes for no explicit reason. Joel is strangely trusting resulting in his death, Ellie is more boyish/aggressive, Tommy is practically bipolar and never seems to know what he wants.The game centres around revenge, but in the most ridiculous and complicated way possible. After Joel's death, Ellie spends most of her gameplay going on killing sprees taking down unlikable innocents, dogs, and pregnant woman, but when she finally has the opportunity to take down the one woman solely responsible for the death of her father figure, she can't bring herself to do it. It honestly felt like watching the Final Destination (everything always goes wrong) movies crossed with Kill Bill, but made worse than both with an anticlimactic ending.Abby's gameplay is spent dealing with an irredeemable cult (which honestly drags on and feels out of place compared to the rest of the themes in the game), with flashbacks trying to make the player feel for her... - It misses the mark. Abby's father was the surgeon Joel kills from the previous game, the game even establishes that Abby was aware he was going to have to kill Ellie, and there was a chance a cure couldn't be produced. With that said, you would think she would have been aware enough to know that her father operating on an unconscious/unwilling girl was a mistake just asking for trouble... But her pettiness/desire for revenge overthrows this, showing how mentally weak she is. It's hard to relate to a character that is so unhinged.Now... The big elephant in the room... Joel's death, this has been explained in full depth by many other people. But what I will add, is that the disregard for characters like this shows a lack of passion from the writers, and shows they don't even understand what was previously established.There are many other nitpicks/plotholes/story gripes I could spend hours on, but they're understandable for video games (And still probably less ridiculous than Uncharted 4's eight foot wall stopping Elena and Sully from carrying on with Nate, when they've climbed crazy buildings, and Nate had a rope on him. - Thanks for that one too Neil.-GAMEPLAY/PHYSICS-Oh boy oh boy, how people are raving about a generic third person setup is beyond me, and a buggy one at that.The Last of Us Part 2 is basically a copy and paste of the first game, and uses the same engine. You have the typical ""stiff-feeling"" character models, upgrades that make the game far too easy on higher difficulties, and a LOT of walking around/interacting with objects/environment between combat sections, which becomes tedious in a shooter with a bad story. Only difference this time is that we now have a jank jump button (or should I say buttons) that looks incredibly awkward when performing (like the characters are fish jumping out of water). We also have some changes to make hand to hand combat easier, but also more lengthy, and some terrible changes to the beloved bottles/bricks from the first game.The A.I in the game is exactly the same as it was in the first game, Left Behind, Uncharted 4 and Left Behind... And let me be upfront now, this is bad. I understand those games are a little more loved by gamers, but they all had terrible A.I that act the same. If you explore gameplay without following traditional methods of play, you'll notice every enemy will resort to chasing you in the open regardless of their role. (They will also quickly lose you if you hide and often not bother to check the area you were last seen at). It's felt so unnatural and has made gameplay very unsatisfying for me. Back in Uncharted 1-3, enemies played roles based on their weapons, shotguns would always flank you, assault rifles would stay at mid-range but sometimes get close or distance themselves, snipers always kept their distance, while it may sound simplistic by word, it was much more enjoyable as each combat encounter felt like a puzzle as opposed to a bunch of idiots rushing you. I recall in Uncharted 4 having a good laugh as I left a single sniper on the map that kept chasing me down trying to punch me, he was absolutely hopeless but determined to not use his gun. TLOU2 brings this back, and it's a shame. It should also be noted that the A.I is often unresponsive and had trouble hitting/grabbing you in certain segments.Friendly A.I isn't much better, unlike the early Uncharted games, where if you tried ditching your partner while they were in trouble, they'd die and you'd have to restart. TLOU 2 brings in an awkward system where you can ditch your partner that's in trouble, then they'll suddenly appear next to you once",1.0,"Hate speech detected in categories: violence, individual, group"
Dissapointment: The Video Game,ffbaa,23 June 2020,"Game play is average, for the most part boring. The combat is fun but the AI seems to hate stairs, because it looks like they can't handle it properly. Combat-wise it is a step up from the last game. Every now and then though, you get to ""play"" some ""long corridor"" sections, very linear, with nothing going on whatsoever.The graphics and soundtrack are amazing. The closer it comes to an art piece is when you look at the world and you can hear all the sounds playing in the background. Every track has meaning to it and they always enhance the scene.However, the plot is contrived and very nonsensical up to the point I'm playing, and it's a shame because The Last of Us is supposed to be a narrative driven franchise. Characters in this game behave completely differently from the first game, in fact, if weren't for the voice actors I wouldn't believe they are the same people. Joel gives the feeling he completely abandoned his life. Ellie evolved into such a brat that at times I barely care for what happens to her. Abby's background is weak and it's hard to feel any empathy for why she did what she did. It keeps switching perspectives for no reason, sometimes it feels as if they had just thought of something and snucked that in right at the very moment it came to their minds. There was a point I thought I was sitting through a CW's Batwoman episode, due to how poorly paced and out of place everything felt.I don't think I'll finish it. I was hoping the plot would get better but it is actually getting worse. Maybe I'll just watch what's left for me to play and quit. I'm very disappointed.",0.0,No hate speech detected.

TLOU fans don't play this positive reviews are lies,bopoh-39331,22 June 2020,"As a tlou fan it is utterly heartbreaking to post such a low review. I can say the only thing I really enjoyed is the new game mechanics but other then that the story is very poorly written and not well done. I feel they really betrayed TLOU fans and robbed us of what TLOU is all about, Joel and Ellie's journey. That is what made the game come to a big frenzy but this one really is a slap in the face to fans. Spoilers you don't even get true justice for Joel in the end and his killer lives on when they shouldn't. The thing is the truth never got out Joel never really wanted to kill the surgeon in the first one the fireflies never gave him a chance they put guns in his face and told him to leave and he reacted properly. They never told Ellie they wanted her to die to find this cure so the fireflies did wrong in the first place and for this group of former fireflies to come after Joel with out this knowledge and these assumptions is utter nonsense. They were trying to make it sound one sided without bringing all the rest of the info in to justify Abby and her horrible actions. I feel very robbed of a TLOU experience, they took away that Ellie and Joel experience and just threw in other characters to make a terrible story about people no one gives a damn about. I am very heartbroken by naughty dogs decision here on what they did and how they decided to end this series but this is not a TLOU game it is just some over glorified game with too many positive reviews from people who aren't TLOU fans. This game will collect dust on the shelf and periodically if I spot it I'll just be reminded of the long awaited disappointment we got with this release. TLOU 1 is for me and I'll just go to playing that and re living what I feel in love with the first time round and try to put this part 2 abomination behind me.

It's no surprised that I was excited when hearing about part 2, I played it, and was very disappointed, the disrespect of Joel's character was terrible, the love between Ellie and Dina seemed forced and not organic, the game play with Abby is utterly boring and uninteresting, and the ending was no payout at all and unsatisfying, and being told that I'm a bigot for not liking it, makes me dislike it even more, luckily, I bought it in the store, so this bigot will be returning it no doubt.",1.0,Hate speech detected in categories: group
what a desappointment !,jad-05872,22 June 2020,"What a desappointment! what to say ....
the game is so bad that I'm glad I didn't waste my money!
before the first last of us was an adventure game full of emotion and full of memorable moments ...
but now it looks like a game of teenagers nothing more! the story is banal it looks like a teen movie about romantic relationships and nothing more and sex scenes that is the most stupid thing iv'e ever wedn
I'm really disappointed that they brought out such a bad game and ruined the story of the first one!

"Finished it, processed it... still feel empty",josephryan-35346,21 June 2020,"Disclaimer: loved the first
Ill keep it short.
Barely any new gameplay mechanics? Only been in the making for SEVEN YEARS.
Repetitive: go one place, clear it, go another place, clear it- for THIRTY HOURS
The graphics were great 7 years ago, but have not improved at all (albeit still decent). Esp. with red dead graphics, this pales in comparison.
The worst crime however was the ending, which is so depressing it made me wanna snap my disk. Ellie deserved a better ending, on a farm with Dina. Her revenge plot has made her unreconisable as a character. And I miss Joel. I feel as empty as Ellie did at this point, the only character I care about is Dina!
Also, is the cure storyline over? Would give the series some purpose at least

I got to let something very clear to be just, the voice acting is one of the best I've ever seen in any media. It's not even in the same sphere other games I've played.

They don't understand he saved Ellie because he had the chance. when his daughter got killed he didn't have the chance to save her it was so sudden. They could have made his death mean something and drive the story to new heights. Joel's death is treated with absolutely zero respect, it's the cheapest death since the sword guy from Indiana Jones. So she kills everyone to get to her, even a pregnant woman and a guy who told her what she needed to hear and didn't need to die, and got killed anyway, but she spares Abby because she only then realizes that there is a kid with her. She has a flashback, so she sets off to kill Abby, travels for months, only to have another flashback from the same night, but from a few hours later, so she changes her mind. That's not how memory works. Maybe only if you have amnesia. It was a worst pointless story that has no soul and is not worth telling. Character decisions made no sense whatsoever and it's a stain on the memory of the original. The core of the game is the relationship between Joel and Ellie.

I Hope I Wake Up Tomorrow and Naughty Dog Delays The Game Again,jyttrup1,20 June 2020,"I've played a lot of video games for a long time, and the Last of Us is up there as one of the 10 best games I've ever played. Naughty Dog has been almost perfect in all of their games. Jak & Daxter: amazing. Crash Bandicoot: awesome. Uncharted: My favorite game series of all time.Then there's Last of Us 2. The prime example of what happens when some hot shot writer decides they're more concerned with their political agenda and their chance to tell a teenage emotional roller coaster story than they are about pleasing the players who keep them in business.The gameplay is... basically the exact same as the first game. The graphics are better (as they should be... it's been SEVEN YEARS after all). But the storyline takes a dump all over the mastery of the first game.In this game you get an angsts teenager who looks like Shrek lead a band of people you'd just as soon see on The Bachelor as they hunt down our characters from the first game. They then rip off the Walking Dead and kill a character you've come to love by killing him with sporting equipment. Then another brutal murder of one you love, and attempted murder of another character you love, all for the game to force you to let the antagonist (which the game forces you to play as so you can experience their awkward Teenage love triangle) just walk away.This takes the cake as the worst game I've ever had the misfortune of wasting my money on.

Ignore the 10/10 scores.,pyoung-51652,19 June 2020,"People giving this game 10/10 haven't got a clue and must be casual gamers. If they did indeed like the first game, they would hate the way Joel act massively out of character and get himself killed.People saying you ""didn't understand the story"" if you didn't like this game, are in fact clueless themselves on what makes a good story, with good pacing, structure and narrative.Compared to the first game, this one is a massive step backwards. The last of us gradually developed a beautiful relationship between Joel and Ellie. Neither trusted quickly but eventually they completely relied on each other and Joel did everything to save Ellie.This game makes the first one meaningless. Joel and Tommy managed to survive all this time in a post apocalyptic world, then tell a bunch of randoms their names and base location. They would never do that. NEVER. The writing on the sucks.Between Joel's death, Ellie not going through with killing Abbie and losing her fingers in the process (when Abbie bites them off), what is the point of this game. What is the message?You can't argue that the game's graphics are stunning, but all ND games are. It's expected. But graphics do not make a good game. On top of that, the game play hasn't progressed and felt old and clunky and highly repetitive.Overall I was not impressed. maybe the game was hyped up too much and I expected more.

Horrible Story,shallon4000,19 June 2020,"It's like the creators of the first game hated their creation and then came out with this one. They throw their characters under the bus for new characters that you don't like. They take the original story and ruin it with this one. And they clearly had an agenda as their primary focus.I'm a progressive liberal, but this just goes overboard! Christians are bad, white people are out of touch, and trans and gay folks are all victims. At this point, they should have just put Trump in it, with a hat that said 'Make The Apocalypse Great Again' and be done with it.There is a time and place for everything. Video games should be there for escapism and fun, and not for preaching an agenda.At this point, I'm not only burnt with the Last Of Us franchise. (They ruined the story!!!!).

Seven years. Seven god damned years I've waited for the sequel to one of the best stories not just games, but stories0 I've ever had the pleasure to be involved with. TLOU had incredible acting, a great story, emotion, beautiful graphics and originality...
And what to they give us For TLOU2None of that. Nada. Zip.Don't be drawn in by the trailers, some of the scenes involving Joel don't even exist in game. They're there to manipulate you into thinking that Joel,and Ellie are off on another adventure. Somewhat strained after the end of the first game... but still. The two of them together.Now I'm no fool. I never wanted a sequel, mainly because I knew the only way they could match the emotional drama of the first, would be to kill Joel. And that's just bad storytelling. But that's how they go.... they take our rough, tough survivor from the first game who doesn't trust ANYONE. And have him drop his guard laughably, has him trust a stranger he just met fully and gives them his name.And the outcome? He gets gut shot and beaten to death with a golf club in super high definition.Earth to Neil Druckman. Even Game of Thrones had good writing, character and plot when they killed a main character. You sir, are not Game of Thrines. And this was bad.It's almost like they knew it was terrible, so they had to make the murderer transgender -mall so they can go to the marketing campaign and shout""Look, look how inclusive we are! Lesbians in the first game, transgenders in this game. Look!""Dude. A good character is a good character regardless of age, sex or whatever... you can't make them a good character JUST because of their orientation. It's like you were so obsessed with Ellie being gay, you needed to take it further.IT DOESNT MATTER.If it was good writing, we wouldn't need to know. Subtle hints in the story would do, and we could work it out ourselvesBut forget all that. That's not why it's a terrible, terrible game that lacks imagination, character development or consistency, a decent plot or originality.You took one of the most cliched and over used plots of any bad B movie, and wrote a game around it. You then killed one of the most beloved characters in gaming in such a pathetic, out of character way and had his death mean nothing. Nothing at all was achieved by it.
You then force us to play as his killer...not only someone we hate, but have ZERO interest in. Then back to Ellie, who decides all the death and murder in the game is just...actually not worth it. Killing is bad...🙄Seriously? We can't even get revenge?This is terrible on every level. Don't believe the critics raving about it. Their clearly terrified of being labelled transphobic (clever move Druckman)Plus points. Graphics are beautiful, the acting from Ashley and Troy is incredible.
