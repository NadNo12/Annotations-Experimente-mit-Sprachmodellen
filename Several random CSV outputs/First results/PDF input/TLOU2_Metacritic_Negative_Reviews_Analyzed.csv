JesseDillinger," If you don't wanna see me bashing this game, this is not the review for you. This has nothing to do with the fact they're females, lesbians, or even Joel. I was enjoying the game at ﬁrst, but once you play an hour or 2 of this game the entire rest of the game is the exact same thing. So the gameplay...Once you've explored one place, you've explored them all. What's that? You need loot? Here's multiple empty drawers to waste your time and a safe that has a letter next to it telling you the code anyway to pad the runtime more. You gotta get through this door? Hold triangle and slowly scooch through it. An enemy grab you or get on you? Spam square. You want an interactive cutscene? Here, we have MANY slow paced walking sections of just characters walking and talking that you can't do **** in. Have to get to a certain area AGAIN? Move this dumpster, turn on this generator, just basically press and hold triangle even MORE. Do these things over and over and over and over and over and over and over for multiple hours until you beat the game. The only good thing about The Last of Us games are the stories, and both times the story is something that feels super familiar and isn't unique in the slightest. I can't help but compare this to something like Resident Evil. But in Resident Evil the pacing is better, the gunplay is SO much better and they keep you more invested with boss ﬁghts (Well, GOOD boss ﬁghts. Like oh boy that one boss ﬁght with Abby where if you get within a foot of it you insta die. So bad). In this game I just got so tired of sneaking, pressing triangle, press square, throw a bottle, sneak, press triangle, press square. That's the combat if you choose to be stealthy. Which they REALLY want you to do. I got so bored with stealth and just started shooting up the place as much as I could. I tried the silencers a few times, but in order to make those you gotta do the boring a*s repetitive looting. And after a few hours I got sick of looting and just started zooming through the story. The Last of Us games are proof enough for me to know that I will not like the Uncharted series. I'm a gameplay ﬁrst guy and this gameplay is NOT it. Naughty Dog, it's time to change up your ****. This is like a small step above Far Cry. And I f*cking HATE Far Cry. Your gameplay is outdated and I just know The Last of Us 3 is gonna be a copy paste with maybe one or two small changes As for the story. The story isn't AWFUL, but why the f*ck am I supposed to care about Abby? I just genuinely don't care. We know Joel is a scumbag. He made a greedy choice and killed people that probably didn't deserve it. We get it. We don't need to play as Abby for 7 f*cking hours to know that Joel was in the wrong. I still don't give a **** that your dad and friends died. And you DESPERATELY wanted her to be the Joel of her story by throwing in the little Scar kid I don't give a **** about either. I've been with Ellie for about 24 hours worth of story and I care for her a little bit. You can't force me to like Abby as much as Ellie in that little amount of time. Ellie didn't learn that revenge = bad. The WHOLE game is her wanting revenge, the ONLY reason she doesn't go through with it is cause she couldn't get to Abby. Then you try to make us feel even MORE bad for Abby by making her get kidnapped and strung up. Such trash. And the ONLY reason Ellie didn't kill her is cause she just randomly had a sudden change of heart cause that **** was forced on her. You think she would've learned after killing the pregnant girl, but nope. She leaves Dina and the kid for revenge and just completely wastes her time and loses Dina in the process. TLDR: Much like Ellie's whole adventure, this game was a waste of my time. I didn't like the gameplay cause it's dull and repetitive in the worst way, the story is very weak and dumb, and I don't care about most of the people in this game. I will NOT be playing part 3. NaughtyDog is not the developer for me.",4,"Jan 7, 2024",1,Hate speech detected. Keyword: 'hate'. Intensity: Medium
Futureuwu," It's kinda extremely mid. Doesn't live up to its predecessor, and it deﬁnitely doesn't live up to the Sony games we're used to. In an attempt to subvert expectations, it's single handedly killed the franchise, as is clear with the poor sales it's received.",1,"Jan 6, 2024",1,Hate speech detected. Keyword: 'kill'.

ReviewFreak," ""Despite its excellent visual presentation, music, and voice acting, The Last of Us Part II has been the subject of controversy due to narrative decisions that divided the gaming community. Some critics and players found that the direction of the story, particularly certain events and character decisions, generated polarization and disappointment among those hoping for more direct continuity with the ﬁrst installment. This led to a mixed reception, with some considering that the plot choices negatively aﬀected the overall experience of the game. , especially for those who had high expectations based on the previous installment.""",3,"Jan 5, 2024",0,No hate speech detected.
Somebody1," I would give this a 4/10 but I want to balance out the stupid 10/10s. This game has some of the worst writing in games, stupid characters, most uninspired gameplay and the only thing I liked I about the game was the graphics and the somewhat alright soundtrack and sound design. This game made me so frustrated with Naughty Dog and the fact they ruined a perfect franchise.",0,"Jan 5, 2024",0,No hate speech detected.
MrWiggles117," It’s like the ﬁrst game, but without any likable characters and constant convoluted and boring ﬂashbacks and unskippable scenes to remove any enjoyment you might have had.",4,"Jan 2, 2024",0,No hate speech detected.
Nekolex," It was a beautifully well done game mechanically. But if you had any love for the ﬁrst, and the characters and how they were written, then it is such a spit in the face… ironically because druckman inserted himself as a character to spit on Joel… there was insane disputes going on internally during its development and for good reason. Just hold the story of the ﬁrst one dear to your heart, and… this Atrocity doesn’t exist for us. Also no online lmaoooooooolol",0,"Dec 29, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
Silegin," The idea that Ellie is angry at Joel for denying her a choice ignores the fact that the ﬁreﬂies did so aswell. They took her, they drugged her, and they threatened Joels life when he questioned their motives. He had every right to go full papa wolf and the fact the game does not even allow him to defend himself is disgusting. “There was a sequel, wasn’t as good” - Joel 2013",2,"Dec 28, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
JeannWagmaker," The gameplay, setting, progression and soundtrack are the most impressive you'll ﬁnd in a game, but it's not worth the absurd script failure. There is nothing anyone can say that makes sense of Joel's decision to tell his real name to a stranger -- after more than 20 years of experience in a cruel world, full of terrible people, having killed so many whose acquaintances would love to see him dead. Just as there is no sense in Ellie's decision to have killed so many, abandon her family to obtain the revenge that absolutely everyone wanted and, in the end, save the person she was supposed to kill and who caused so much disgrace to everyone she loved. All of these ﬂaws are only justiﬁed if you, as a writer, wanted the story to be about an empowered woman replacing the cis straight white man, but anyone who has played both games knows that in no alternate universe would that woman beat Joel. This game was a mistake. An error that showed how a bad script can ruin a game whose other aspects are exceptional.",0,"Dec 25, 2023",1,Hate speech detected. Keyword: 'kill'. Intensity: High
tap_dance126," Implausible story, great graphics. This game is not for those who want to experience happiness at the end of the game.",1,"Dec 24, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
Kabhold," Horrible, lazy writing. Subverting expectations doesnt make a story automatically good nor does it mean its great writing. Revenge is bad, so kill a few hundred people but dont kill the person who killed your friend. Dumb. Lazy. Writing. Gameplay is good.",1,"Dec 22, 2023",1,Hate speech detected. Keyword: 'kill'.

Nerakus, An absolute disappointment ****. I can’t believe I wasted so much time and money on this. They really messed up the storytelling.I get what they were trying to do but it really doesn’t work. Such a bummer to play after Playing the ﬁrst game. It’s not worth it.,0,"Dec 20, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
deltanine," This is the next Metroid Other M.  It is a pinaccle of giant middle ﬁngers to fans of the ﬁrst game and if Neil Drunkman weren't so egotistical and didn't let Anita Sarkeesian poison his mind, this game wouldn't be as widely hated as it is.  As far as I'm concerned the real reason gaming journalists gave this game all those Game of the Year Awards was to troll the people that criticized the game.  Neil Drunkman had no excuse to kill oﬀ Joel within  the ﬁrst hour of the game.  Remember Resistance 2?  In that game, Nathan Hale had a far more digniﬁed demise.  He did something of value before he died, he died from a swift gunshot to the head, he was killed so that he doesn't become a Chimera monster, and he dies at the end of the game.  In Resistance 3, we play as Hale's killer but we are far more willing to do so, because he was far more sympathetic and he was remorseful for killing Nathan even though he knew it was the lesser of two evils.  Bottom line: Last of Us Part II is an abomination and Neil Drunkman deserves to be ﬁred.",0,"Dec 19, 2023",1,Hate speech detected. Keyword: 'hate'. Intensity: Medium
kaisuisen, This game would be good if not the holes in the plot and if we could skip entire 10hr of play as Abby. Abby and genderbender Lev are like Joel and Elly? No way. Part 2 doesn't exist. It's some fanﬁc written by 19 yo activist under pills.,0,"Dec 17, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
RoRolando," Big disappointment after the ﬁrst part. I recognize the criticism that it is a terrible story.  Unfortunately but true. Most personalities are insuﬀerable. In addition, too often there is aimless walking and talking. The number of times you get jumped in a cut scene is ridiculous. *spoiler* in the end I did not even care if one of them would survive. The graphics part saves things somewhat. Very disappointed!",2,"Dec 17, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
NastyWheeler," Aufgrund der linke wokeness leider nicht spielbar! Der Protagonist des ersten Teils, welcher von jedem geliebt wurde wird einfach von einem unwichtigen Charakter getötet, von dem man vorher noch nie etwas gehört hat!",0,"Dec 16, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
Zhuotai12," Gameplay is good and amazing graphics. Plot was just trash and forced.  Terrible writing and no substance to the new characters. People who gave this game a great score are just sadistic, mentally ill, and thrive on people hating the game. Probably the same people who thought the ﬁrst game was so predictable too.",2,"Dec 15, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
DorianBarberYT," All the good this game has, the great animations, gameplay, crafting, shooting & thrill. None of that matters without the multiplayer. On The Last Of Us Remastered I have 1575 hour and the vast majority of that is from the Multiplayer. I probably only put about 25 hours in the story. I purchased Part 2 knowing that it was having the multiplayer worked on. Then they announced that we would get the stand alone multiplayer. Now that’s been cancelled and we have nothing. What a complete disappointment.",0,"Dec 15, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
," GruﬀMG Worst writing in a video game EVER. A complete bore to play through and very repetitive. The characters are boring and unlikable. The story makes no sense and the characters make really dumb decisions. So bad it can ruin your initial experience from the ﬁrst game which was incredible. I do not recommend, pretend this game doesn't exist if you enjoyed the ﬁrst one. Other than the nice graphics, there is nothing here to enjoy.",0,"Dec 11, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
Silent-Heal," I wrote a review of this part in the review of the ﬁrst part. This part is terrible in terms of plot. An outrage to the player, to the script, to common sense. I think the scriptwriters of ﬁlms and games are sick, they have some kind of psychological problems, hatred, depression, despair. In most scenarios, they constantly kill all the characters, even the main ones. Disgusting part, disgusting ending, the whole game was a waste. Don't write scripts, go get treatment from a psychologist and stop excruciate people. I hope I never see your games, much less buy them. Because of such fools there is nothing to watch anymore.",0,"Dec 6, 2023",1,Hate speech detected. Keyword: 'kill'. Intensity: High
darkrings," Naughty Dog's battle design is not so prominent in today's big game year, tlou1 is a strong story driven game, every time you sneak and assassinate, explore the map just to see the new story, and when neil made the story like this, it was clear that the game was useless. A ton of pointless lgbtq elements, coupled with various scandals from the producers, all I can say is that if you haven't tasted **** to ruin your day, just taste this video game lol",0,"Dec 5, 2023",0,No hate speech detected.
Tarnvxxs," The gameplay of this game has no strong diﬀerences from the 1st part, the plot was disappointing with the death of the senseless Joel, because we killed him hard, and we spent the whole game trying to take revenge, and in the end what? we didn't take revenge :). We were running after Abby senselessly just to let her run away? Absolutely senseless death of Joel, he could have been removed from the list in another way... I was literally forced to play as Abby, I can’t express in words how negative this character makes me feel I’m not talking about a bunch of unnecessary LGBT propaganda in places. The gameplay and zombies (infected with Cordyceps) are deﬁnitely still fun and scary. Tlou 3 can be saved, if it start with Joel words “wake up,Ellie ”",1,"Dec 3, 2023",1,Hate speech detected.
